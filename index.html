      <p>my emacs review:</p>
      <p>pros: emacs lisp almost feels like a real programming language</p>
      <p>
        cons: literally the worst defaults out of ANYTHING ive ever seen</br>
        oh well its just a default right? i can obviously disable it right?</br>
        hahahahhaa think again! if u google about any of the INSANE defaults they have</br>
        first answer u get: NOOO DONT DISABLE IT, THIS ISNT A PRIMITIVE TEXT EDITOR, THIS IS ADVANCED</br>
        the advanced "features" in question: automatically align shit with spaces, literally WHY?</br>
        oh yea its so much more readable to start the next line in the right edge of the screen, floating in the middle of nowhere</br>
        another great feature: lets auto close ur brackets and autoenable it in every single place</br>
        i can close the brackets on my own in whose head was this a good default?</br>
        oh and another con, the community</br>
        its like the vim community on steroids OH MY GOD</br>
        like just do something useful in ur life instead of obsessing over a MID text editor</br>
      </p>
      <p>for comparison. in vim the only defaults i changed: change tab width to 4 and use spaces instead of tabs</p>
